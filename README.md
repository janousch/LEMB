This is an Unreal Engine 4 template project for Level Editor Modes.
It is possible to use just blueprints for the level editor mode! No C++ required!
This project can also be used as a base for more advanced level editor modes, made in C++. In this case the widget creation with slate could be skipped!

* No C++ skills required!
* Dynamic widget update inside the editor!
* Simple to use!

This template will help you to build an level editor mode as quickly as possible with or without C++.
